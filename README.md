# Tiny URL Manager

## Problem Statement

- This project addresses the need for a system that can generate and manage short URLs to make sharing and accessing long URLs more convenient.

## Functionality Components

### 1. URL Shortening

 - The system provides functionality to shorten long URLs into short versions. 
 - This process involves generating unique short URLs for given long URLs and storing them in the database for later retrieval.

### 2. URL Redirection

 - Users can access the original long URLs by using the short URLs generated by the system. 
 - When a short URL is accessed, the system redirects the user to the corresponding long URL, allowing access to the desired content.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- MongoDB
- Redis
- pymongo (Python MongoDB driver)
- redis-py (Python Redis client)

 - MongoDB serves as a durable storage solution, ensuring that the short URLs are persistently stored for future retrieval. 
 - Redis acts as an in-memory cache, providing fast access to frequently accessed URL mappings.
 - The use of Redis cache enhances the performance of the application by reducing latency. 
 - By storing frequently accessed URL mappings in memory, Redis reduces the need to query the MongoDB database for every request, thereby decreasing response times.
 - The combination of MongoDB for durable storage and Redis for caching improves the efficiency and responsiveness of the application.

## Backend Process

### Key Generation

 - A unique short key is generated for each long URL submitted to the application. 
 - This key serves as a compact representation of the original URL. 
 - This process typically utilizes algorithms or encoding techniques to ensure uniqueness and efficiency. 
 - The generated short keys are stored in a MongoDB collection for future retrieval and association with their corresponding long URLs.

### URL Lookup and Redirection Logic

 - When users access the shortened URLs, the system redirects them to the original long URLs associated with those short URLs.
 - It first checks Redis for the full URL based on the short URL. If not found, it checks MongoDB.
 - Upon finding the full URL in MongoDB, it stores it in Redis for faster access in subsequent requests.

### Routing

 - The application, built using Flask, defines routes to handle incoming requests.
